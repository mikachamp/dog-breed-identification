## 🧠 Model Training
[Jump to Table of Contents](#📋-table-of-contents)

The project uses **MobileNetV2** as a feature extractor, fine-tuning the model for dog breed classification. Key steps:
1. Data preprocessing: Resizing images, one-hot encoding labels.
2. Data augmentation: Increasing dataset variety.
3. Model training: Using TensorFlow/Keras with callbacks like EarlyStopping.
4. Evaluation: Analyzing accuracy, loss, and misclassified examples.
